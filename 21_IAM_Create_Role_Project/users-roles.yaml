# =============================================================================
# USER-ROLE CONFIGURATION FILE
# =============================================================================
# This YAML file defines the user accounts and their role assignments for the
# IAM Role Management system. It serves as the single source of truth for
# user permissions and role mappings.
#
# STRUCTURE:
# users: List of user objects
#   - username: String - The IAM username (must be unique)
#     roles: Array - List of roles assigned to this user
#
# AVAILABLE ROLES:
# - readonly: Read-only access to all AWS services
# - admin: Full administrative access to all AWS services
# - securityAudit: Security auditing and compliance access
# - developer: Development-focused permissions (VPC, EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS)
#
# ROLE ASSIGNMENT RULES:
# - Users can have multiple roles assigned
# - Role combinations determine the effective permissions
# - Users can only assume roles they are explicitly assigned
# - Role assumption requires switching roles in the AWS console or CLI

# User definitions with role assignments
users:
  # User: shah
  # Assigned roles: securityAudit + developer
  # Permissions: Security auditing capabilities + development service access
  # Use case: Senior developer with security responsibilities
- username: shah
  roles: [securityAudit, developer]

  # User: zaryab  
  # Assigned roles: readonly
  # Permissions: View-only access to all AWS services
  # Use case: Junior team member, auditor, or external consultant
- username: zaryab
  roles: [readonly]

  # User: ammar
  # Assigned roles: developer
  # Permissions: Full access to development-related AWS services
  # Use case: Application developer working with compute, storage, and databases
- username: ammar
  roles: [developer]

# TO ADD NEW USERS:
# 1. Add a new user entry following the structure above
# 2. Assign appropriate roles based on job function
# 3. Run 'terraform plan' to review changes
# 4. Run 'terraform apply' to create the user and role assignments
#
# TO MODIFY USER ROLES:
# 1. Update the roles array for the target user
# 2. Run 'terraform plan' to review permission changes
# 3. Run 'terraform apply' to update role assignments
#
# SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
# - Regularly review user role assignments
# - Follow principle of least privilege
# - Remove unused user accounts promptly
# - Monitor role assumption activities through CloudTrail
